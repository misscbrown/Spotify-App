# Spotify Social

This is a social app for users of Spotify to share their favourite tracks, discover new tunes and join discussions on tracks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Inspiration

This is a project for our bootcamp with Birmingham University. We wanted to do something that incorporated the Spotify Api, to make an interactive application that is accessible to Spotify users. We worked as a team of 3, and started with the back end, which we tested using Graphql. 

## User Journey

As a user... 

## Challenges

Getting the oEmbed to work
Displaying the cards using Tailwind
Working with Graphql and testing all the mutations
Posting and deleting comments
The Spotify Api - couldn't get it to work with Graphql

## Future development

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## oEmbed

We used oEmbed to embed the Spotify URL's in this application. Each embed provides a 30 second preview clip.
